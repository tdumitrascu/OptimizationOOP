# OptimizationOOP
The Lazy evaluation model ensures that any computationally intensive algorithm is executed only if/when the user requests the result. The Caching mechanism accesses the storage of the result for any computationally intensive algorithm (i.e. after its execution). Thus, the stored result is available in the future, if the user performs the same query again, and can be returned directly (i.e. without running the algorithm in question again).
